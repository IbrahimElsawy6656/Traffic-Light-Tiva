                       ~ Traffic Light System ~

the traffic light system contains two cars traffic light 
one from NORTH to SOUTH and one from EAST to WEST also
beside each one there is pedestrain traffic light, our system depends on
interrupts only came from timers and switches (no polling),
we have used timer0, timer1 and systick also Port A and Port B for LEDs
and switches and finally UART0 for sending the state of the system.
